      <p id="rev1">Teaching the Christian faith is integrated in all we do, because we believe in one God who is eternally revealed through the Creator, our Heavenly Father and source of knowledge; through Jesus Christ, His only Son and our source of salvation; and through the Holy Spirit, the Sustainer and Giver of Faith.

        Qualified Christian teachers provide an excellent learning environment of safety, security, respect, and Christ’s love.
        
        Academic excellence is attained through the core curriculum, which is sequential, cumulative, and developmentally appropriate for each grade level.
        
        Students experience educational opportunities to develop good communication, problem solving, critical thinking, and collaborative skills enabling them to lead the Church and their generation into the future.
        
        Students are encouraged to be good stewards of all the Lord has entrusted to their care, utilizing their time, talents, and energies for the glory of God and the welfare of others.
        
        Parents are an integral part of their child’s educational experience, partnering with the school to promote spiritual, academic, physical, and social growth.
        
        AVCS uses and develops curriculum that will further the love of learning, increase knowledge, glorify God, challenge students, and follow a consistent developmental scale, while meeting and exceeding the state competencies.
        
        As an extended ministry of Lutheran Church of the Cross (LCC), Laguna Woods and Aliso Viejo,  AVCS invites all students and families to worship weekly, attend Sunday School, and participate in ongoing Christian ministries at their own local churches or, if they do not belong to a local church, at LCC.  Lutheran Church of the Cross is an evangelical, Christ-centered, and Bible-based family of faith.  You are welcome at all worship services and or activities.
        
        Aliso Viejo Christian School has a non-discriminatory policy.  We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national or ethnic origin in the administration of our educational policies, admission policies, or any school-administered programs.</p>
